            My name is Thomas Eckert. I live in Seattle, Washington with my
            wife,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://sophiaross.me/">Sophia</a>, and our
            corgi, Winona.

            I studied physics, focusing on nuclear interactions for fusion
            diagnostics. Much of this work involved programming simulations in
            C++. I wrote a

            After completing my Masters of Physics at the University of
            Rochester, I moved to Seattle and started working at Microsoft as an
            engineer. Today, I build platform tooling for defining SLOs on
            Azure.
